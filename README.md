ATB
=====

ATB stands for "Attack throw block". These are the three basic actions a player
can do in a match that gives a traditional fighting game its rock-paper-scissors
nature. This is a game founded on the fundamentals found at the heart of all
fighting games. The aim of the game is to feature gameplay centered around
zoning, footsies, reactions, and priority. There will be little to no link
combos, with combos being limited to normals canceling into specials.

This game is being developed firstly for the HackPrinceton hackathon. We hope to
further expand it after its first working prototype.
