I guess data structures isn't a good name. It's more like player structure.


We have this Controller class that listens for inputs and presents a nice easy
public array to read keys being pressed. This is mostly re-used code from
Ghost in the Machine.

The Player class has these classes in it:
	Controller*
	Sprite*
	GameState*
